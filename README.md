# poetry-to-setup-py
A Docker image responsible for converting pyproject.toml to setup.py;

The main idea of this project is to make your poetry based project being available as a editable dependency in another project.

Actually if you try to checkout your poetry based library and try to install another project via pip -e ../your_project you won't be able to get it working since pip doesnÂ´t understand `pyproject.toml`, but `setup.py`.

In order to overcome this issue, this docker command will run into your poetry based repository and generate a setup.py, so you can use in another repo as an editable dependency. Also don't forget to add the generated setup.py in your project .gitignore.

Probably this project will be obsolete as soon as pip natively supports `pyproject.toml` directly.

Until there, have fun!


# How to use it

In your poetry project that you want to use as a editable dependency, please do:

    $ cd <your_poetry_project>
    $ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work -u $(id -u):$(id -g) joepreludian/poetry-to-setup-py
